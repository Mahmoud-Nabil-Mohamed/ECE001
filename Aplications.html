<h1>Aplications of AI </h1>
<h1>1-marketing</h1>
<h2>Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is built solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!

In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product. But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item. It’s like these search engines read our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. An example of this is finding the right movies on Netflix.</h2>

<h1>2-health care </h1>
<h2>when it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI. There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.

An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke.

Another such example is Coala life which is a company that has a digitalized device that can find cardiac diseases.

Similarly, Aifloo is developing a system for keeping track of how people are doing in nursing homes, home care, etc. The best thing about AI in healthcare is that you don’t even need to develop a new medication. Just by using an existing medication in the right way, you can also save lives.</h2>

<h1>3-Gaming </h1>
<h2>Gaming

ver the past few years, Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of the gaming industry. In fact, one of the biggest accomplishments of AI is in the gaming industry.

DeepMind’s AI-based AlphaGo software, which is known for defeating Lee Sedol, the world champion in the game of GO, is considered to be one of the most significant accomplishment in the field of AI.

Shortly after the victory, DeepMind created an advanced version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Zero which defeated the predecessor in an AI-AI face off. Unlike the original AlphaGo, which DeepMind trained over time by using a large amount of data and supervision, the advanced system, AlphaGo Zero taught itself to master the game

<h1>4-Space Exploration </h1>
<h2>Space expeditions and discoveries always require analyzing vast amounts of data. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is the best way to handle and process data on this scale. After rigorous research, astronomers used Artificial Intelligence to sift through years of data obtained by the Kepler telescope in order to identify a distant eight-planet solar system.Artificial Intelligence is also being used for NASA’s next rover mission to Mars, the Mars 2020 Rover. The AEGIS, which is an AI-based Mars rover is already on the red planet. The rover is responsible for autonomous targeting of cameras in order to perform investigations on Mars. </h2>

<h1>5-Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
<h2>For the longest time, self-driving cars have been a buzzword in the AI industry. The development of autonomous vehicles will definitely revolutionaries the transport system.
Companies like Waymo conducted several test drives in Phoenix before deploying their first AI-based public ride-hailing service. The AI system collects data from the vehicles radar, cameras, GPS, and cloud services to produce control signals that operate the vehicle.
Advanced Deep Learning algorithms can accurately predict what objects in the vehicle’s vicinity are likely to do. This makes Waymo cars more effective and safer.</h2>

<h1>6-Social Media</h1>
<h2>Ever since social media has become our identity, we’ve been generating an immeasurable amount of data through chats, tweets, posts and so on. And wherever there is an abundance of data, AI and Machine Learning are always involved.

In social media platforms like Facebook, AI is used for face verification wherein machine learning and deep learning concepts are used to detect facial features and tag your friends. Deep Learning is used to extract every minute detail from an image by using a bunch of deep neural networks. On the other hand, Machine learning algorithms are used to design your feed based on your interests.</h2>
